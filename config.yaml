  sectionProblem:
    title: The current problem with software supply chain security
    subtitle: Software supply chain attacks are on the rise and unless you have enterprise-scale security and IT funding, it’s hard to know what your software is at risk for and how to protect it. Many tools are available to help you generate Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), signed attestations, and vulnerabilities, but they stop there, leaving you to figure out how one piece of software affects another. 

  sectionVision:
    title: Our Vision
    subtitle: GUAC (Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition) aims to fill in the gaps by ingesting software metadata, like SBOMs, and mapping out relationships between software. When you know how one piece of software affects another, you’ll be able to fully understand your software security position and act as needed.

  sectionBeta:
    title: GUAC Beta is coming soon!
    subtitle: Coming soon!
      #subtitle: In the Beta, you can run GUAC internally in your organization to take active steps to manage risk. Currently, you can query SLSA provenance, SBOMs, and OpenSSF Scorecards. In the future, GUAC aims to run as a public service where high-fidelity supply chain security metadata can be attained for every software ecosystem.

      quote: With the growing number of software supply chain security (SSCS) data, tools that allow us to find relevant information are crucial. Guac, providing graph representation of software packages, dependencies, vulnerabilities, attestations, etc. is a great tool for use cases in this domain. With mechanisms to ingest and certify data from various sources and GraphQL API to later query those data, we see it as a good foundation for our current and future SSCS efforts. Being a true open source initiative with a welcoming community is just a plus.

      quote: At Yahoo, we have found immense value and significant efficiency by utilizing the open source project GUAC. GUAC has allowed us to streamline our processes and increase efficiency in a way that was not possible before. It allows us to ingest large number of SBOMs and also provides an interface to visualize the current state of images & packages used at Yahoo in real time. We look forward to continuing to utilize GUAC and contribute to its growth in any way we can.
